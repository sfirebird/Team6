## Implementation of IOCTL in Kernel:

1. Define a struct file_operations:      
    - Declare and initialize the structure with pointers to the driver functions.
    ```C
        Define struct file_operations with:
        - .open = my_open_function
        - .release = my_release_function
        - .read = my_read_function
        - .write = my_write_function
        - .unlocked_ioctl = my_ioctl_function
    ```

2. Implement the driver initialization:
    - Modify the ```oled_driver_init()``` to register the character device and create the sysfs interfaces.
    ```md
    In oled_driver_init():
    1. Register the character device:
        dev_major = register_chrdev(0, "device_name", &file_operations_structure)
        Check for errors:
            If registration fails, print error and return

    2. Create a device class:
        device_class = class_create(THIS_MODULE, "device_class_name")
        Check for errors:
            If creation fails, unregister the character device and return

    3. Create the device:
        device_object = device_create(device_class, NULL, MKDEV(dev_major, 0), NULL, "device_name")
        Check for errors:
            If creation fails, destroy the class and unregister the character device
    ```

3. Implement Driver Cleanup
- Modify oled_driver_exit() to clean up the resources
    ```md
    In oled_driver_exit():
    1. Destroy the device:
        device_destroy(device_class, MKDEV(dev_major, 0))

    2. Destroy the device class:
        class_destroy(device_class)

    3. Unregister the character device:
        unregister_chrdev(dev_major, "device_name")
    ```

4. Implement Supporting Functions
- Provide implementations for file operation handlers:
    ```md
    Define my_open_function():
        Perform necessary initialization
        Return success or appropriate error code

    Define my_release_function():
        Perform necessary cleanup
        Return success or appropriate error code

    Define my_read_function():
        Copy data from kernel buffer to user buffer
        Return the number of bytes read or error code

    Define my_write_function():
        Copy data from user buffer to kernel buffer
        Perform actions based on the data
        Return the number of bytes written or error code

    Define my_ioctl_function():
        Perform actions based on IOCTL commands
        Return success or error code

    ```
