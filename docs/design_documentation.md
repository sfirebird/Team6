## Layers and Interaction

### Application Layer:

💻 User applications interact with the display library to perform high-level operations like drawing shapes or displaying text.

### Display Library:

📚 Provides an abstraction layer, exposing APIs such as draw_pixel, write_text, and clear_screen.

⚙️ Interfaces with the driver via system calls like write and ioctl. The write system call will allow user-space applications to send data and commands to the driver, which are then forwarded to the SH1106 OLED over the I2C bus. The ioctl system call will enable control operations such as setting contrast, screen orientation, or enabling power-saving modes, providing a flexible way to interact with and configure the display.

### Driver Layer:

🛠️ The kernel driver manages hardware communication through I2C and processes commands from user space.

Probe Function: 🧪 Initializes the SH1106 display and validates hardware.

File Operations: ✍️ Implements read, write, and ioctl for user-space communication.

### Hardware Layer:

🖥️ SH1106 OLED display receives data and commands via the I2C bus.

## Detailed Flow

### Initialization:

🛠️ The driver registers with the I2C subsystem.

🔍 Upon detecting the SH1106, the probe function initializes the display.

📂 A device node (/dev/sh1106) is created for user-space interaction.

### User-Space Interaction:

📚 Applications use the library to invoke high-level commands.

⚙️ Library translates commands into raw data/commands sent to the device via ioctl or write.

🛠️ Driver processes these commands and communicates with the SH1106 through I2C.

## 3.2 Modular Design

Driver Components

## Core Module:

🛠️ Manages initialization and teardown of the driver.

⚙️ Handles communication with the I2C bus.

## Display Interface Module:

✍️ Provides low-level functions for sending commands and data to SH1106.

⚙️ Handles display-specific operations (e.g., setting contrast, clearing screen).

## User-Space Interface Module:

📂 Implements read, write, and ioctl functions.

⚙️ Interfaces with the display library.

## Library Components

### Graphics Module:

🖌️ Provides APIs for pixel and text rendering.

### Communication Module:

⚙️ Wraps system calls for interacting with the driver.

## 4. Implementation Plan

### 4.1 Phase 1: Basic Driver Development

🛠️ Implement probe and remove functions for SH1106.

✍️ Add basic write support for sending data to the display.

🧪 Test initialization sequence using SH1106 datasheet.

### 4.2 Phase 2: User-Space Library

🖌️ Develop APIs for pixel manipulation (draw_pixel, clear_screen).

✍️ Implement text rendering support.

🧪 Test library functions with a simple application.

### 4.3 Phase 3: Advanced Features

🚀 Optimize driver for partial screen updates to enhance rendering performance, especially for dynamic content such as scrolling text or animations. This involves implementing efficient data transfer protocols that only update the modified parts of the screen.

🖼️ Add framebuffer support for seamless graphics integration. By linking the SH1106 display to the Linux framebuffer subsystem, applications can use standard graphical APIs to render complex visuals directly on the display.

🔋 Implement power management features, such as sleep mode, to conserve power when the display is idle. This can be achieved by sending specific commands to the SH1106 to turn off the display or reduce brightness.

## Potential Applications and Scenarios:

🕹️ Gaming Interfaces: Optimized screen updates allow for smooth gameplay visuals on embedded devices.

📊 Industrial Monitoring: Efficient rendering of real-time data such as graphs or metrics with minimal power consumption.

🎵 Music Players: Enhanced user experience through seamless integration of album art and track details.

🛠️ Prototyping Tools: Developers can use framebuffer support for rapid development and debugging of graphic-heavy applications. 🚀 Optimize driver for partial screen updates.

🖼️ Add framebuffer support for seamless graphics integration.

🔋 Implement power management features (e.g., sleep mode).
